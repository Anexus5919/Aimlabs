# üéØ Aimlabs Clone: Three.js Aim Trainer

## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to **Aimlabs-Threejs**! This is a simple, browser-based 3D aim trainer built with **Three.js** and bundled with **Vite**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This aim trainer is equipped with essential features for a focused practice session:

* **Difficulty Selection**: Choose between **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** modes.
    * **Easy**: Targets appear closer, in a smaller area, and are visually larger.
    * **Medium/Hard**: Targets appear further away, in a larger area, offering a greater challenge.
* **Time-Based Sessions**: Select a predefined duration (1, 2, or 3 minutes) or set a **Custom** time for your practice.
* **Real-time Score & Timer**: Track your hits and remaining time directly on the screen.
* **Detailed Post-Session Statistics**: After the timer runs out, a modal displays key performance metrics:
    * **Final Score**
    * **Accuracy (%)**
    * **Missed Shots**
    * **Shots Per Minute**
    * **Average Time Between Hits**
* **Minimalist 3D Environment**: The game features a black background and a red target to minimize distractions and focus purely on aiming mechanics.
